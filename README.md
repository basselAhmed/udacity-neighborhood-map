**Neighborhood Map** project finds your current `IP` address then uses geolocation to find your most approximate location, sure enough it ain't accurate and might find yourself at the sea but that's the best I could do without GPS nor `HTML5 geolocation API` because that requires `SSL` connection to work and I can't gurantee that all people open up from a secure connection on their server or something.

## How to use
- You can simply open up [Neighborhood Map](https://basselahmed.github.io/udacity-neighborhood-map/).
- or if you wanna get your hands dirty with the code:
-- Download or clone this repo on your local machine.
-- Extract the files in your web server root directory, Here's a web server if you don't have one [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).
-- Open up index.html and enjoy.

## Technologies used
- KnockoutJS - For MVVM Structure.
- jQuery - For quick manipulation of the DOM.
- MaterializeCSS - For UI Elements like sidebar, buttons and tooltips.
- Google Maps API - Surely for displaying the map xD.
